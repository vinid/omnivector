OmniVector provides a simple interface to vector databases. We integrate the main functionalities of different vector dbs,
generally indexing and searching, into a single interface. This allows us to easily switch between different vector dbs.


.. code-block:: python

    db = WeaviateDB()  # or PineconeDB() or LanceDB()

    encoder = SentenceTransformerEmbedder("paraphrase-MiniLM-L6-v2", device="cpu")
    docs = ["the cat is on the table", "the table is on the cat", "the dog is mining bitcoins"]


    ids = list(range(4, len(docs) + 4))
    embeddings = encoder.embed(docs)

    db.create_index()
    db.add(ids, docs, embeddings)
    search_vector = encoder.embed(["the dog is mining bitcoins"])[0]
    print(db.vector_search(search_vector, k=1))
